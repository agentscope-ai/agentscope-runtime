### Develop
#### 1. Download template
Download link: https://bailian-cn-beijing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/project/agentscope-bricks-starter.zip

#### 2. Develop your own full-code app and complete local testing
Ensure the health check endpoint at localhost:8080/health is healthy during testing.

### Deploy
#### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.10
- Install runtime and required cloud SDKs:
#### 1. Download agentscope-runtime
```bash
pip install agentscope-runtime && pip install "agentscope-runtime[deployment]"
```
#### 2. Set the required environment variables:
```bash
export ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...            # Your Alibaba Cloud AccessKey (required)

#### 3. Packaging Method A: manually build a wheel
1. Ensure the project can be built into a wheel. You may use setup.py, setup.cfg, or pyproject.toml.
2. Build the wheel
```bash
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```
3. Deploy
```bash
runtime-fc-deploy \
  --deploy-name [your app name] \
  --whl-path [relative path to your wheel file, e.g. "/dist/your_app.whl"]
```
