# Deploy a ReAct Agent with Tool Sandbox

This tutorial demonstrates how to create and deploy a *‚Äúreasoning and acting‚Äù (ReAct)* with AgentScope Runtime and [**AgentScope framework**](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope).

```{note}
The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) paradigm enables agents to interleave reasoning traces with task-specific actions, making them particularly effective for tool interaction tasks. By combining AgentScope's `ReActAgent` with AgentScope Runtime's infrastructure, you get both intelligent decision-making and secure tool execution.
```

## Prerequisites

### üîß Installation Requirements

Install AgentScope Runtime with the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install agentscope-runtime
```

### üê≥ Sandbox Setup

```{note}
Make sure your browser sandbox environment is ready to use, see {doc}`sandbox` for details.
```

Ensure the browser sandbox image is available:

```bash
docker pull agentscope-registry.ap-southeast-1.cr.aliyuncs.com/agentscope/runtime-sandbox-browser:latest && docker tag agentscope-registry.ap-southeast-1.cr.aliyuncs.com/agentscope/runtime-sandbox-browser:latest agentscope/runtime-sandbox-browser:latest
```

### üîë API Key Configuration

You'll need an API key for your chosen LLM provider. This example uses DashScope (Qwen), but you can adapt it to other providers:

```bash
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Import Dependencies

Start by importing all necessary modules:

```{code-cell}
import os
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from agentscope_runtime.engine.runner import Runner
from agentscope_runtime.engine.agents.agentscope_agent import AgentScopeAgent
from agentscope_runtime.engine.services.context_manager import (
    ContextManager,
)
from agentscope_runtime.engine.services.environment_manager import (
    EnvironmentManager,
)
from agentscope_runtime.engine.schemas.agent_schemas import (
    MessageType,
    RunStatus,
    AgentRequest,
)
```

### Step 2: Configure Browser Tools

Define the browser tools your agent will have access to (To configure additional tools for the agent, see the ‚ÄúTool Usage‚Äù section in {doc}`sandbox`):

```{code-cell}
from agentscope_runtime.sandbox.tools.browser import (
    browser_navigate,
    browser_take_screenshot,
    browser_snapshot,
    browser_click,
    browser_type,
)

# Prepare browser tools
BROWSER_TOOLS = [
    browser_navigate,
    browser_take_screenshot,
    browser_snapshot,browser_click,
    browser_type,
]

print(f"‚úÖ Configured {len(BROWSER_TOOLS)} browser tools")
```

### Step 3: Define System Prompt

Create a system prompt that establishes your agent's role, objectives, and operational guidelines for web browsing tasks:

```{code-cell}
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a Web-Using AI assistant.

# Objective
Your goal is to complete given tasks by controlling a browser to navigate web pages.

## Web Browsing Guidelines
- Use the `browser_navigate` command to jump to specific webpages when needed.
- Use `generate_response` to answer the user once you have all the required information.
- Always answer in English.

### Observing Guidelines
- Always take action based on the elements on the webpage. Never create URLs or generate new pages.
- If the webpage is blank or an error, such as 404, is found, try refreshing it or go back to the previous page and find another webpage.
"""

print("‚úÖ System prompt configured")
```

### Step 4: Initialize Agent and Model

Set up the ReAct agent builder with your chosen language model from the AgentScope framework :

```{code-cell}
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent
from agentscope.model import OpenAIChatModel

# Initialize the language model
model=OpenAIChatModel(
    "gpt-4",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
),

# Create the AgentScope agent
agent = AgentScopeAgent(
    name="Friday",
    model=model,
    agent_config={
        "sys_prompt": SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    },
    tools=BROWSER_TOOLS,
    agent_builder=ReActAgent,
)

print("‚úÖ Agent initialized successfully")
```

### Step 5: Create the Runner

Establish the runtime by creating a runner that orchestrates the agent and essential services for session management, memory, and environment control:

```{code-cell}
@asynccontextmanager
async def create_runner():
    async with Runner(
        agent=agent,
        context_manager=ContextManager(),
        environment_manager=EnvironmentManager(),
    ) as runner:
        print("‚úÖ Runner created successfully")
        yield runner
```

### Step 6: Define Local Interaction Function

Implement a local interaction function to test your agent's capabilities with direct query processing and streaming responses:

```{code-cell}
async def interact(runner):
    # Create a request
    request = AgentRequest(
        input=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": "What is in example.com?",
                    },
                ],
            },
        ],
    )

    # Stream interaction with the agent
    print("ü§ñ Agent is processing your request...")
    async for message in runner.stream_query(
        request=request,
    ):
        # Check if this is a completed message
        if (
            message.object == "message"
            and MessageType.MESSAGE == message.type
            and RunStatus.Completed == message.status
        ):
            all_result = message.content[0].text

    print("üìù Agent output:", all_result)
```

### Step 7: Run Interaction

Execute the interaction flow to test your agent's functionality in a local development environment:

```{code-cell}
async def interact_run():
    async with create_runner() as runner:
        await interact(runner)

await interact_run()
```

### Step 8: Deploy the Agent Locally

Transform your agent into a production-ready service using the local deployment manager for HTTP API access:

```{code-cell}
from agentscope_runtime.engine.deployers import LocalDeployManager

async def deploy(runner):
    # Create deployment manager
    deploy_manager = LocalDeployManager(
        host="localhost",
        port=8090,
    )

    # Deploy the agent as a streaming service
    deploy_result = await runner.deploy(
        deploy_manager=deploy_manager,
        endpoint_path="/process",
        stream=True,  # Enable streaming responses
    )

    print(f"Agent deployed at: {deploy_result}")
    print(f"Service URL: {deploy_manager.service_url}")
    print(f"Health check: {deploy_manager.service_url}/health")
```

### Step 9: Run Deployment

Execute the complete deployment process to make your agent available as a web service:

```{code-cell}
async def deploy_run():
    async with create_runner() as runner:
        await deploy(runner)

await deploy_run()
```

### Summary

By following these steps, you've successfully set up, interacted with, and deployed a ReAct Agent using the AgentScope framework and AgentScope Runtime. This configuration allows the agent to use browser tools securely within a sandbox environment, ensuring safe and effective web interactions. Adjust the system prompt, tools, or model as needed to customize the agent‚Äôs behavior for specific tasks or applications.
